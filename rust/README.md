# Metaparticle/Sync rust library

Metaparticle/Sync for rust is a library that implements distributed synchronization for
cloud-native applications using a container sidecar and Kubernetes primitives.


## Quickstart

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`

```
[dependencies]
metaparticle_sync = "0.1"
```

## metaparticle_sync in action

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate metaparticle_sync as sync;


fn main() {
    let lock = lock!("some-lock");

    // Attempt to lock without retrying.
    lock.lock(|| {
        // do some important work
    });

    // Block and attempt to grab the lock up to 10 times.
    lock.lock_with_retry(|| {
        // do some important work
    });

    // Block and attempt to grab the lock forever.
    lock.lock_with_retry_forever(|| {
        // do some important work
    });

    // Election
    let election = elect!("some-election", 
                          || {
                            // Do some work when leader.
                          },
                          || {
                            // Do some work when follower.
                          });
    election.run();
}
```
